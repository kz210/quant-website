A constrained portfolio optimizer solving mean-variance with turnover and cardinality constraints. Implements CVX-style optimization and heuristic genetic algorithms for mixed-integer constraints.

## Highlights

- Quadratic programming formulation  
- L1/L2 regularization and turnover control  
- Backtesting framework included
